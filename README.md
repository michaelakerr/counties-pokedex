### Pokemon Viewer

This small web app was created to view the pokemon from the free to use PokeAPI and view some relevant detail about them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and relies on the following packages:

1. React-Admin - a frontend framework which utilises default functionality in data to create easy patterns for API communications.
2. Material-UI - a front end component library for react which allows customisation depending on how much is required.
3. Github pages - website hosting for static applications using a git repository.

### To run the application

1. Clone repository from the repo
2. Project can be run locally using
    1. `npm run start` or `npm start`.
    2. `npm run build` creates a build for production
3. To deploy changes to github pages:
    1. Commit to repository
    2. `npm run deploy` will cause the predeploy and deploy scripts to run with a default message of "Updates" in the commit message.
